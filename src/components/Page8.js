          The chakravyuha as seen in the mahabharat has 7 layers. This can be
          unlocked by using a simple calculation as follows Each layer = 1
          divided by 7 = 0.142857142857….. This is the pattern to break each
          layer. Soldiers will be entering the whirlwind of layers indefinitely.
          Like wise as one progresses to next layer one numeral increases. So at
          the 7th layer it still increases. 0.142857*2 = 0.285714 – Layer 2.
          Here the number of soldiers are doubled. 0.142857*3 = 0.428571 - Layer
          3. Here the number of soldiers are tripled. .... 0.142857*7 =
          0.999999999 – Layer 7. The number of soldiers that will be entering in
          batches. Arjuna must have had an energy level higher than this. This
          is the mathematical trick in Chakravyuha.
